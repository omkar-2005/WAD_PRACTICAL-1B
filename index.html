<h2 class="three"> Features Of Coffee </h2>
<img src="./imag2.jfif" alt="" width="700px" height="300px">
<p> <strong>"Junk coffee"</strong>  isn't a formal term but generally describes coffee that's 
    low-quality, artificial, overly sweetened, or made with unhealthy 
    additives, contrasting with natural, high-quality brews; think heavily 
    processed instant mixes or sugary concoctions loaded with syrups and 
    artificial flavors, serving as a cheap or quick fix rather than a 
    genuinely enjoyable coffee experience. It often lacks the balanced aroma,
     flavor, and mouthfeel of good coffee, focusing instead on intense sweetness 
     or caffeine delivery</p>
